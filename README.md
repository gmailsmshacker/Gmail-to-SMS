Gmail-to-SMS
============

This Google Apps Script will check for new emails in your Gmail account and send you an SMS every time a new email comes in. It is recommended to set it up to run every 5 minutes for proper operation. To send you an SMS the script will insert temporarily an event into your Google Calendar with an SMS notification (be sure to setup SMS notifications in Google Calendar). The SMS will contain an abbreviated portion of the subject and message. Enjoy!
